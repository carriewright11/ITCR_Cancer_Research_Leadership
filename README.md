# Leadership for Cancer Informatics Research

This course is created with Bookdown and covers material about best practices and tools for managing a multidisciplinary team for informatics research. 

This course is a part of an [ITCR training series](https://www.itcrtraining.org/) and was in part created from [this github template](https://github.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown).

## About this course

Informatics research often requires multidisciplinary teams. This requires more flexibility to communicate with team members with distinct backgrounds. Furthermore, team members often have different research and career goals. This can present unique challenges in making sure that everyone is on the same page and cohesively working together. The course is intended for researchers who lead research teams or collaborate with others to perform multidisciplinary work. We have especially aimed the material for those with **moderate to no computational experience** who may lead or collaborate with informatics experts. However this material is **also applicable to informatics experts working with others who have less computational experience.**

We will provide you with an awareness for the **specific challenges** that your informatics collaborators, employees, and mentees might face, as well as ways to mitigate these challenges. By creating a better work environment for your informatics research team, you will ultimately improve the potential impact of your work. 

We will also discuss the major **pitfalls of informatics research** and discuss best practices for performing informatics research correctly and well, so that you can get the most out of your informatics projects.
