# Informatics lab management tools

There are several tools that can be especially useful for assisting with day-to-day management of projects involving informatics regardless of if you are simply collaborating with an informatics expert or you are leading an informatics research team.

## Slack


[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a communication tool that allows you to communicate with lab members much more efficiently than email. It is a bit like a combination of an instant message system, email, and dropbox.

You can do quite well with the free version of slack. It may be all that your research group needs indefinitely. The major difference between the free version and the paid versions is that the free version does not save all of your message history. 

Currently, with the free version you can search through the history of the last 10,000 messages. From our experience using this with a department with about 250 users, it takes about a year to reach this threshold. If you choose to go with the free option and share any really important messages or files, make sure to save them just in case.

## How to use slack?

### Workspaces

The main landing page for slack is called a workspace, which looks like this:

In the above image, this person has five workspaces which are indicated by the squares on the far left. Each workspace allows for multiple channels for communicating. These channels can include all members of the workspace or specific subsets of members. Team members can also have separate direct messages to have one-on-one discussions.

It's a good idea to check if your department or institute is already using slack. If so, they may have a workspace that you can join. Otherwise you may want to think about recruiting your department or institute to start using slack. In this case you could start a workspace where people outside your research group can communicate. This would still allow you to have group messages with your lab or specific groups within the lab. Otherwise, you can start a workspace just for your research group. 

### Channels

Channels are the main way in which you can converse with your team on slack.

We recommend making a slack channel for your entire research group. Everyone in your group will be able to discuss something by sending messages in real time. If someone is not available at that time, they will see the message when they next check slack. 
We also recommend making project specific channels. For these channels you can add all of the team members working on a specific project, so that they can easily discuss and review discussions about the project. 

Importantly, you can make channels private or public. If a channel is public, anyone in the workspace can join.

They're best when organized around a topic - #marketing, for example. Provide a name and optionally a description. You can also decide to make a channel private, it can only be viewed or joined by inivitation." alt="Create a channel: Channels are where your team communicates.

## Features

### Pins

If someone sends a really important message, like a link to a relevant document, you can "pin" the message so that it is easier to find later. 

Hovering over a message you will get the following options:

Clicking on the 3 dot button allows you to do several useful things for a message including pinning it to find it easily later.
