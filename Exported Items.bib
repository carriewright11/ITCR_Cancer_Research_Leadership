	abstract = {The dynamic intersection of the field of Data Science with the established academic communities of Statistics and Biostatistics continues to generate lively debate, often with the two fields playing the role of an upstart (but brilliant), tech-savvy prodigy and an established (but brilliant), curmudgeonly expert, respectively. Like any emerging discipline, Data Science brings new perspectives and new tools to address new questions requiring new perspectives on traditionally established concepts. We explore a specific component of this discussion, namely the documentation and evaluation of Data Science-related research, teaching, and service contributions for faculty members seeking promotion and tenure within traditional departments of Statistics and Biostatistics. We focus on three perspectives: the department chair nominating a candidate for promotion, the junior faculty member going up for promotion, and the senior faculty members evaluating the promotion package. We contrast conservative, strategic, and iconoclastic approaches to promotion based on accomplishments in data science.},
