The inclusion of diverse research team members may promote more inclusive research questions and practices to help the populations that need better health care the most. “Racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States are at disproportionate risk of being uninsured, lacking access to care, and experiencing worse health outcomes from preventable and treatable conditions.”(Jackson and Gracia 2014) “…Compared with the general population, racial/ethnic minority populations have poorer health outcomes from preventable and treatable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome than those in the majority.”(Jackson and Gracia 2014) “… the social environment in which people live, learn, work, and play contributes to disparities and is among the most important determinants of health throughout the course of life.”(Jackson and Gracia 2014) More diverse research teams may be more aware of the cultural differences and social determinants that may influence the health of the people that the research could serve. Such consideration could further increase the impact of the research. The inclusion of diverse populations in scientific teams has also been shown to improve innovation (Hofstra et al. 2020). “Scholars from underrepresented groups have origins, concerns, and experiences that differ from groups traditionally represented, and their inclusion in academe diversifies scholarly perspectives. In fact, historically underrepresented groups often draw relations between ideas and concepts that have been traditionally missed or ignored.” (Hofstra et al. 2020) 5.2 Underrepresentation in cancer informatics Despite the benefits of diversity in research teams, analyses of scientific article authorship indicate that women are underrepresented in computational biology (Bonham and Stefan 2017) and biomedical engineering (Aguilar et al. 2019). Furthermore, analyses of university faculty and students demonstrate that both women and historically marginalized populations (such as Black, Hispanic, and Native American) remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the US and in Europe (Hofstra et al. 2020; Chaudhary and Berhe 2020). 5.3 Underrepresentation in clinical trials Beyond underrepresentation of certain populations within research teams, there is also a lack of representation of various populations (in particular Black and Latinx individuals) in clinical trials (Clark et al. 2019) and in particular for cancer studies(Nazha et al. 2019). According to a study in 2011: African‐Americans represent 12% of the U.S. population but only 5% of clinical trial participants. Hispanics make up 16% of the population but only 1% of clinical trial participants. (Coakley et al. 2012) Furthermore, when looking at oncology trials: Contemporary oncology trials continue to be characterized by an overrepresentation of white and male participants (80% and 59.8%, respectively). (Nazha et al. 2019) This lack of diverse participants is a problem because this results in less understanding about how particular patients will fare with a given treatment/vaccine/diagnosis etc. and this lack of knowledge can therefore result in furthering inequities in medical care (Clark et al. 2019). This is due to a number of reasons: 1) Mistrust According to studies, marginalized groups such as Latinx and Black Americans reasonably distrust researchers at higher rates than white individuals due to historical injustices and inadequate medical care. Studies et al. (1999) African Americans’ suspicions and fears that many sectors of American society are not trustworthy were logical and accurate interpretations of their perceptions and experiences. (Griffith et al. 2020) Examples of historical injustices include: a.[Tuskegee syphilis trial]((https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/history/40-years-human-experimentation-america-tuskegee-study): A study in [Tuskegee, Alabama about the outcomes of untreated syphilis in Black males] (1932-1972) in which the patients were told they were being treated but were in fact not being treated. “The Unfortunate experiment”: A study in New Zealand (1966-1987) in which women diagnosed with a precursor to cervical cancer were also similarly studied but patients were not offered standard treatments,they were not informed of their diagnosis, and they were not told that they were a part of a trial, nor given the opportunity to decide if they wanted to be a part of the trial. Henrietta Lacks HeLa Cells: In 1951, a patient named Henrietta Lacks was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins. Her cancerous cells turned out to be uniquely capable of surviving and reproducing and have been used widely in research for decades for many discoveries. However according to a report, &gt; “None of the biotechnology or other companies that profited from her cells passed any money back to her family. And, for decades after her death, doctors and scientists repeatedly failed to ask her family for consent as they revealed Lacks’s name publicly, gave her medical records to the media, and even published her cells’ genome online.” STD experiments in prisons and Guatemala According to a report, &gt; “The study involved at least 5128 vulnerable people, including children, orphans, child and adult prostitutes, Guatemalan Indians, leprosy patients, mental patients, prisoners, and soldiers. Between 1946 and 1948, health officials intentionally infected at least 1308 of these people with syphilis, gonorrhea, and chancroid and conducted serology tests on others. The study originally began in the United States but was moved to Guatemala when researchers were unable to consistently produce gonorrhea infections in prisoners at a Terre Haute, Indiana, prison.”(Rodriguez and García 2013) Radioactive iodine thyroid studies of Alaskan natives In the 1950s, a study was conducted to study the thyroid gland in Alaskan natives, in which participants were given doses of radioactive iodine that exceed current recommendations. Due to improper care for language barriers, participants were not carefully excluded for pregnancy, lactation etc. and participants were also not able to be properly informed about the risks of the study and therefore not able to provide proper consent.(Hodge 2012) Importantly, this is only a sample of examples. Many other individuals among a variety of populations such as those who were imprisoned (Rodriguez and García 2013), economically disadvantaged, those with mental disabilities, children, the elderly, those with mental illness (Millum 2012), and those among other groups have also been abused by unethical research practices Park and Grayson (2008). This historical context, which has in many cases directly impacted individuals and their families or communities has unsurprisingly made many people weary of participating in clinical research.(Griffith et al. 2020) “We, as African Americans were always the pilot test… I know because people have experienced it within my line, my family, my bloodline in [city name]. Yeah.” He continued by saying, “So I just think that we’ve been used and misused a lot of times within the African American community and in the lower parts of the devastation where the devastation lies.” (Griffith et al. 2020) “I’m thinking about horror stories like the Tuskegee experiment and things like that. Like stuff that for me, were mentioned back in school and were mentioned by my family members…”(Griffith et al. 2020) Health care inequity Beyond such examples of extremely unethical studies and practices, marginalized populations such as Black, Latinx and Native Americans have also historically received poorer health care thus discouraging engagement with the health care system.Hodge (2012) African Americans, Latinx, and other racial or ethnic minority groups have a long history of receiving inferior quality of medical care even when they have the same level and type of insurance and access to care. (Griffith et al. 2020) An analysis of 1 million patients with cancer in the United States showed that blacks or African Americans have a 28% higher cancer-specific mortality compared with whites. This survival gap is independent of sociodemographic factors, disease stage, and access to treatments. Indeed, disparities exist along the continuum of care, from screening, access to care, and referral to subspecialty centers, to enrollment in clinical trials that define new approaches to cancer treatment.(Nazha et al. 2019) A lack of recruitment/inclusion Implicit biases involve associations outside conscious awareness that lead to a negative evaluation of a person on the basis of irrelevant characteristics such as race or gender.(FitzGerald and Hurst 2017) Based on the available evidence, physicians and nurses manifest implicit biases to a similar degree as the general population. The following characteristics are at issue: race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status (SES), age, mental illness, weight, having AIDS, brain injured patients perceived to have contributed to their injury, intravenous drug users, disability, and social circumstances.(FitzGerald and Hurst 2017) Sadly, this can result in researchers not including certain populations in their trials. Healthcare professionals have been shown to withhold treatments based on preconceived notions about whether the racial/ethnic minority patient would adhere to the protocol (Yates et al. 2020) A lack of researcher cultural competency and passion Participants noted that trust is influenced not only by the scientific expertise of the researchers, but also by the researchers’ knowledge of the history, context, and experience of the study populations. (Griffith et al. 2020) In addition, participants noted that the enthusiasm, commitment, or passion of the researcher to help the population of interest and to study the topic of interest influenced how trustworthy the researcher appeared to be. (Griffith et al. 2020) A lack of access …in addition to the limited participation by racial minorities, access to cancer trials is only available to a minority of patients, with approximately 27% of U.S. patients with cancer having access to trials. (Nazha et al. 2019) There are many barriers to access. One major important barrier is translation of recruitment materials to other languages. Another can be the time at which participants are needed to be in person for a clinical trial. Some individuals need more accommodation if for example they can’t come to appointments during work hours due to having a job with an inflexible work schedule or due to care taking responsibilities. Other examples include transportation, if it is more time consuming to get to appointments for a trial due to a need for public transportation or because an individual lives in a different area of town this can inhibit participation and retention of participants. Another dimension of access is health literacy. For individuals who don’t have the time, education, or other means necessary to learn about the importance of specific health interventions or preventative practices for example, they may not be recruited for trials as well as individuals that are regularly concerned with their health and spend leisure time investigating information about their health.(Yates et al. 2020) Lack of community engagement Community engagement can build trust, reduce stigma, increase access, recruitment and retention of more diverse participants for clinical trials. However, there has been historically a lack of funding to support equitable engagement of community stakeholders. Recent projects in which participants are recruited through community engagement, such as project brotherhood (a community based project, that provides Black men in Chicago with health education within their communities) have been shown to help increase health screen participation. 5.4 Strategies to promote more equitable inclusion in clinical trials Provide adequate financial, logistical, and time support Researchers should consider how participants can cope with healthcare needs following participation in a study. Investigators should consider how to support caregivers who have important obligations to tend to their family members or others, for example when possible, perhaps home visits would be feasible. Other strategies include providing flexible hours for trial visits and support for transportation, such as payment for a rideshare service or taxi.(Yates et al. 2020) Researchers should also consider providing patients with a cell phone to improve communication.(Clark et al. 2019) More promotion of health care access in general Individuals have been shown to be more likely to participate when advised by a health care provider.(Clark et al. 2019) Increasing health care system access in general could therefore improve clinical trial participation. More promotion of community engagement Community stakeholders can help to assess if recruitment information is culturally appropriate and can help with creating more equitable recruitment strategies. More inclusive research teams Individuals have been shown to be more trusting when research teams include members that are similar to themselves. (Griffith et al. 2020) 5.5 What does it take for clinical research to be ethical? Here you can see a table of requirements for ethical research trials.(Emanuel, Wendler, and Grady 2000) Such consideration can help to ensure that participants are treated with respect and integrity and with their well-being as the top priority. 5.6 Research practices to reduce cancer health disparities According to a recent article (Zavala et al. 2021) about cancer research in the US the following is suggested to reduce cancer health disparities: Further develop and sustain large diverse cohorts that collect multidimensional/multilevel data. Diversify germ-line and tumor genetics/genomics databases and clinical trials. Develop diverse cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Implement system changes in healthcare coverage to guarantee equity in access to high-quality screening and access to treatment. Improvement and system-wide implementation of patient navigation programs. Employ culturally tailored community awareness and education programs to increase cancer screening (including genetics) and modify risk behaviors. Implement legislation that supports behavioral interventions (e.g. limit the sales of tobacco products). 5.7 Ways to better support a more diverse research team In order to best support and encourage mentees and employees of underrepresented groups in cancer informatics, we suggest that lab leaders do the following: 5.7.1 Seek additional training about disparities in informatics and STEM careers Especially focus on hindrances to achievement such as attitudes, biases, and stereotypes. Also, become aware of stereotype threat (also called stereotyped inferiority) - “an internal feeling and concern about confirming a negative stereotype associated with a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, and age) with which the individual identifies”(Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021) and how they might influence your mentees. Here is a great video of Russell McClain at the University of Maryland that introduces how implicit bias and stereotype threat impact higher education: Note that you may not be aware of all the barriers of achievement that your mentees may face. For example, mentees from low socioeconomic backgrounds, mentees with disabilities, mentees who have immigrated, older mentees, mentees of traditionally underrepresented races and ethnic groups, and mentees with gender identities that are underrepresented face unique and sometimes overlapping challenges. This is not an complete list and it is also important to learn about how intersectionality (the idea that some individuals may represent more than one underrepresented group (ex. female and Black)) results in more nuanced challenges. For example: When the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender is considered, women of color report even less access to mentorship and support from mentors than other groups. (Davis et al. 2021) Here is a great video of Kimberlé Crenshaw (at UCLA and Columbia) describing the theory of intersectionality, which she developed: Also, become aware of microaggressions - “subtle verbal and nonverbal slights, insults, or invalidating remarks directed at individuals due to their membership in a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, age, and physical disability), which are rooted in biases about individuals in that group”(Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021). See below a list of examples: [Source] Importantly, “mentors for students with disabilities should receive training, as needed, on their mentee’s specific disability and should be made aware of the accommodations that students may need to succeed in activities and courses” (Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021). 5.7.2 Acknowledge mentee’s differences Research shows that mentees of underrepresented racial groups would prefer their mentors to directly discuss how to best cultivate their mentee’s career success given their race. An attitude of “color-blindness” about race has shown to hinder the success of mentees (Byars-Winston et al., n.d.; Holoien and Shelton 2012). Talk with your team members individually (be careful not to single out individual team members in front of the rest of the lab) about how they would like to discuss the potential influences of their background/identity on their career growth. “Racial/ethnic differences between mentees and mentors in interracial mentoring relationships can pose cultural barriers to effective mentoring of HU (Historically underrepresented) students and even affect students’ professional and psychosocial success, especially when complex racial/ethnic issues are not effectively handled or addressed…” (Byars-Winston et al., n.d.) “Two ideological perspectives – colorblindness and multiculturalism – have emerged to shed light on this question. Colorblindness downplays the salience and importance of race by focusing on the commonalities people share, such as one’s underlying humanity. In contrast, multiculturalism acknowledges and highlights racial differences (Holoien and Shelton 2012).” “Exposure to colorblind (vs. multicultural) messages predicts negative outcomes among Whites such as greater implicit and explicit racial bias (Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004)” (Holoien and Shelton 2012) “[Underrepresented groups] benefit when others around them endorse multiculturalism (Plaut et al., 2009)”(Holoien and Shelton 2012) 5.7.3 Work to create a safe environment Educate lab mentors about cultural sensitivity and microaggressions. Highlight the importance of collaboration and create a code of conduct for the lab to demonstrate that respect among lab members is expected and required. 5.7.4 Diverse role models Expose all mentees to a diverse range of role models through seminars, journal clubs, and participation in conferences. Computational biology papers with female authors are more likely to have a last author who is also female. It is unclear if this is because women are more likely to hire other women and or if females are more likely to choose a lab with a female adviser (Bonham and Stefan 2017). Indeed, research of females and other underrepresented groups in STEM including students with disabilities and of certain racial and ethnic groups suggests that role models of underrepresented populations are particularly important for recruiting and keeping students interested in fields where they may feel like an outsider (Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021) due to current underrepresentation. One strategy to encourage students of underrepresented populations is to provide students with exposure to such role models through regular seminars where scientists who represent these populations are prominent (Katz 2007). 5.7.5 Advocate for all mentees Introduce your mentee to other scientists and trainees particularly those from a diverse range of underrepresented groups. Encouraging the participation of your mentees in support programs and groups such as graduate student groups. Help mentees cultivate self advocacy practices through open discussions and encouragement. 5.7.6 Support a healthy relationship with failure Be a good role model and openly discuss the role of failure in research. For example, you may describe failures in your own career or you may read some of the book Brilliant Blunders by Mario Livio or this article about the book with your mentees. This book describes how scientific advancement actually occurred due to mistakes of some of the most respected scientists. Educating mentees about the Growth Mindset described by Carol Dweck may also be helpful. The major themes of this mindset is an awareness that our abilities are not fixed, that we can change our aptitudes with practice and work. [source] See here for more information. 5.7.7 Celebration and microaffirmations Be sure to celebrate all of your mentees’ small and large successes. This has been shown to promote confidence and resilience (Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021). Be generous complementing or pointing out small success in discussions with your mentees and thank your mentees for performing tasks that they may assist you or your lab. For larger successes, consider sharing a meal or other social activity with your lab. For virtual or remote lab members this could be playing a game online. Again aim to do this with all your mentees/lab members. Be mindful about not singling out particular mentees. This could further make such lab members feel like they don’t belong. 5.7.8 Give feedback with cultural sensitivity It is important to be aware that your mentee may be struggling with feeling like they don’t belong when you provide feedback (Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021; Lee, Dennis, and Campbell 2007). Thus, when given criticism, certain mentees who may especially feel like they don’t belong because of their background differences, may feel very discouraged. Try to still be encouraging when delivering criticism by acknowledging what is going well and what is progressing. This article has several good tips for delivering criticism that we will summarize here with our own thoughts: Allow for a discussion about what went wrong. You may learn that your mentee struggled for an entirely different reason than you expected. Having a discussion allows you to better determine how your mentee might be able to perform better in the future. Give criticism in a sandwich. Say something positive, deliver the criticism, then say something else positive. Focus on the actions instead of personality traits. Think about how they can improve. For example, instead of saying “You seem to have time management issues,” you could say something like, “Navigating and prioritizing all these projects is a difficult task and I think we can do better as a team.” Be specific and suggest improvements. You want your mentees to know exactly what they should be aiming to improve and why. Vague criticism may reduce their confidence and will not help them improve as much as concrete specific suggestions and discussion. Deliver criticism in private. Especially if your mentee is feeling like they don’t belong, criticism in front of other lab members can really impact their confidence. It can also lead to more unhealthy competitive dynamics between lab members. Don’t surprise your mentees with criticism. Build criticism into regular meetings with your mentee. Don’t create a meeting out of the blue to tell them they need to improve as this may cause excess stress. Secondly, criticism can be normalized if it is delivered gently and in the ways we just outlined. 5.7.9 Consider creating a document of mentor and mentee expectations. These documents help clarify what mentees can expect. This is helpful for your mentees to better perform according to expectations, as they are explicitly stated rather than intuited. [source] Masters and Kreeger (2017) has created a nice set of guidelines for such documents. Also see here for more information about such documents. Keep in mind that such forms should be tailored for different career stages of your mentees and for mentees who are pursuing different expertise. Informatics mentees should incorporate guidelines about data management practices. We will discuss a bit more about that in the next chapter. 5.8 Conclusion We hope that these guidelines will help you to create a safe and more comfortable environment for all of your lab members and to support your team to be more mindful about health inequity when conducting research. We believe that a happier and more inclusive lab has the potential to be more productive and innovative. References "]]
