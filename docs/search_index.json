It is a bit like a combination of an instant message system, email, and dropbox. avocado add to slides [source] avocado update You can do quite well with the free version of slack. It may be all that your research group needs indefinitely. The major difference between the free version and the paid versions is that the free version does not save all of your message history. Currently, with the free version you can search through the history of the last 10,000 messages. From our experience using this with a department with about 250 users, it takes about a year to reach this threshold. If you choose to go with the free option and share any really important messages or files, make sure to save them just in case. 6.2 How to use slack? 6.2.1 Workspaces The main landing page for slack is called a workspace, which looks like this: avocado add to slides - is the alt text ok? In the above image, this person has five workspaces which are indicated by the squares on the far left. Each workspace allows for multiple channels for communicating. These channels can include all members of the workspace or specific subsets of members. Team members can also have separate direct messages to have one-on-one discussions. It’s a good idea to check if your department or institute is already using slack. If so, they may have a workspace that you can join. Otherwise you may want to think about recruiting your department or institute to start using slack. In this case you could start a workspace where people outside your research group can communicate. This would still allow you to have group messages with your lab or specific groups within the lab. Otherwise, you can start a workspace just for your research group. 6.2.2 Channels Channels are the main way in which you can converse with your team on slack. We recommend making a slack channel for your entire research group. Everyone in your group will be able to discuss something by sending messages in real time. If someone is not available at that time, they will see the message when they next check slack. We also recommend making project specific channels. For these channels you can add all of the team members working on a specific project, so that they can easily discuss and review discussions about the project. Importantly, you can make channels private or public. If a channel is public, anyone in the workspace can join. avocado add to slides 6.3 Features 6.3.1 Pins If someone sends a really important message, like a link to a relevant document, you can “pin” the message so that it is easier to find later. Hovering over a message you will get the following options: avocado add to slides Clicking on the 3 dot button allows you to do several useful things for a message including pinning it to find it easily later. avocado add to slides 6.3.2 Code One great feature about slack, is that it is very convenient to message about code. avocado add to slides You can also attach files directly to messages just like in the above message which has a screen shot image file. 6.3.3 Reminders If you want to be reminded about a message in 20 minutes or next week you can also do that using the same hovering and 3 dot button option. avocado add to slides Thus if Jack gets a message from his advisor Charlie, but he is busy doing deep work on something else, he can ask Slack to remind him later. leanbuild::include_slide(&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OU5qeRgN_fojGbcyu2qEdwlcKpDO6BveWtYW_u1Hqd4/edit#slide=id.gd37aae88fc_0_0&quot;) avocado add to slides You may also notice in the image above that your messages can be edited! unlike an email, in addition yoou can mark them as unread, which can also be useful for responding to messages asynchronously. 6.3.4 Polls One other nice feature for working with a team is that you can directly poll your team. Say sally wants to schedule a meeting with the lab teammates for a specific project- this could even include collaborators who are outside of the lab. If all the users are on the same Slack channel, she can send out a poll like this one asking people to resond with times that they are available. avocado add to slides 6.4 Git and GitHub You can learn more about these tools in the Data Management course, however we will give a brief introduction now. Informatics work can especially benefit from keeping track of your steps and the code that you have used. In some cases your lab may use a tool like Galaxy which has built in options for keeping track of the steps that your lab members are taking during their research. However, other tools do not have this option. Instead, we can use a tool called Git which allows for something called “version control”. Version control is the tracking of changes to a file or files overtime. This is equivalent to saving different versions of a grant proposal overtime. However, as you may have noticed, this is not an easy process to maintain. Tools like Git (Git is one of the most popular) help us to keep track of changes. If we save our changes often, we can easily modify our files back to a recent version if necessary. This may be less useful for a grant proposal (although we would argue that it really can be!), but it can be absolutely critical for your informatics code. Why is this? Small changes in your code may result in your code breaking or generating completely different results. To make matters worse, sometimes your scripts may be lengthy, if you have 4,000 lines of code, it can be difficult to identify what is different between one version and another. Git really helps with this. AVOCADO add cartoon about charlie accidentally deleating a script locally- but its ok cause it is on Git! or something like that - could be Jack on his own or a cartoon of harry and sally sharing files and code… So what is GitHub? GitHub is a free hosting site for code (or other files - including those grant proposals!). Therefore, all the different versions of your files can be saved and accessed online at GitHub. You can make these files private or public. According to Wikipedia: As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users and more than 190 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories), making it the largest host of source code in the world. You do not have to use GitHub to use Git. If you have data that needs to be complaint with HIPPA, you could still use Git on a local server (more on this in other courses). Alternatively, you could use GitHub after you de-identify your data. AVOCADO more on using github with sensitive data. See here for info about ways to use GitHub for data that needs to be HIPAA compliant. HIPPA compliancy group https://compliancy-group.com/large-scale-hipaa-security-breach-improper-use-of-github/ reproducibility… (several options here…) GitHub/Git https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/ https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/ 6.5 Docker If you are using a pipeline to process data or creating software that depends on other software programs and particularly if you have multiple team members modifying code for the pipeline or the software, or if you ultimately want to share your pipeline or software, it is recommended that you use a method to ensure that you (as well as you in the future!) and your team and anyone you want to share your pipeline or software with uses the same dependency software of the same versions! There are a few ways to do this, but one of the simplest is to use what is called Docker. You might be familiar with something called a virtual machine. A virtual machine basically allows you to perform operations on your computer, but as if you are using a different computer! This is handy because you can ensure that you not only have similar software installed but you are also working with the same operating system as your teammates (even if your computer has a different operating system). For example you might have a mac, and your teammates might all have windows machines. Pretty cool, right!? Docker is similar to this, except it uses what is called a container. This allows users to work with software that is preinstalled and an environment that is preconfigured, however it uses part of your existing operating system. This is good because it means that it takes less time and resources than using a virtual machine, which includes a full copy of a virtual operating system. Here is the explanation about what containers are on the docker blog: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. See here and here to read more about the differences between virtual machines and containers like Docker. Note that you can use Docker containers within a virtual machine. See here for explanations about host and guest operating systems. In short the host operating system is the local machines operating system (the one with the hardware), the guest operating system is the virtualized operating system. Finally, see here for a deeper explanation about how Docker images and containers work. Like GitHub, there is a DockerHub, where people store different docker images (which is what allow people to run a docker container with all of your software dependencies and configurations on their machine).You can download other people’s docker images, or you can host your own on DockerHub for other people to use your Docker images. The important take-home message is that Docker fixes the issue of having your code work only on your machine but not someone elses. 6.6 Figshare Similar to GitHub, Figshare is another option for hosting and sharing files on the internet that is specifically designed for research related files. Users can host data, code, images, posters, papers, and other types of files to allow others to easily find resources related to your research. In their words: Figshare is a repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner. We make it as simple as possible to make research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Publish research in any file format and assign an institutionally-branded DOI, document with customizable, discipline-specific metadata, [create] discoverable content across major search engines and academic frameworks The difference with GitHub is that it is easier to make files citable (thus ensuring better that you get credit) and it also is a bit easier to store large data files. Figshare does not however have the same version control capabilities of Git and GitHub. Ultimately Figshare is a great place to share final versions of your research products to make them findable for others. Figshare also encourages researchers to publish negative findings that did not ultimately end up in publications to reduce redundancy in the research field, which we think is a great idea! avocado add video https://youtu.be/_q50OWkz4Kc https://youtu.be/WlJlPmoJcJk 6.7 RStudio and R Markdown If your research teammates are using the R programming language often, we strongly suggest that you consider having these teammates use what is called R Markdown to create reports of their analyses. R Markdown is a flavor of what a markup language called Markdown that works especially well with R. What do we mean by markup? A markup language is for formatting text particularly to make it text that can be distinguished form the rest of a document. In our case we want it to look different from our code and the output of our code. Ideally for the sake of reproducibility and transparency, we recommend that your informatics teammates write such R Markdown reports as they are performing their analyses - not afterwards. RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment or IDE for developing code that makes it easy to write such reports. R markdown files make it easy to have a report that shows a bit of the data (or all the data if your data is very small), the code, commentary about what the code is doing, as well the actual output of the code for a given informatics process. We also recommend describing what data you are using, who performed the analysis and when and why, all in one document. This really helps with troubleshooting in the future, as well as simplifying maintaining code over time. It also makes it easier to train new lab members or communicate to collaborators how your code works. The really nice thing about these reports is that Markdown languages allows you to export them in a variety of formats like html websites, pdfs, word documents (or even slide presentations with just a bit of extra work) that can easily be shared with others. You aren’t limited to just writing about code in these reports. You can write about anything. In fact, what you are reading right now was orginally written using R markdown. Thus this is also a good option for writing up reports about wet bench experiments as well. 6.7.1 R Markdown Guidelines There are a few simple syntax rules for R &lt;arkdown. To create headers you can specify them using hashtags. One hastag # is the largest header option, while two ## is a bit smaller, three ### is a bit smaller than two ## etc. Thus you could create a header like so: # This is a header To create bold text you can use asterisks around the text. **This is bold text** Which will look like this: This is bold text To create italicized text you can use two asterisks around the text. *This is italicized text* Which will look like this: This is italicized text To create both bold and italicized text you can use three asterisks around the text. ***This is bold and italicized text*** Which will look like this: This is bold and italicized text To create a new line you include two spaces after the end of the line. To create a divider line you can use three astrix without any text on a line by itself. *** Which will look like the following divider line: You can also embed images or videos into your R markdown reports. There are several ways to do this with a package called knitr which allows you to do all sorts of things with your reports. However you can also do it simply with the following syntax: ![caption text](URL_or_local_path_to_image_or_videofile) If you are including code (which can be R programming language code, Python, SQL, bash or others). You can specify it using three backticks like this: # This is a code comment about some R code- here comes the code on the next line! x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) x ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 or this for Python: (avocado finish this :P) # Now we are going to show some python code x = [1,2,3,4,5] print(x) ## [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for inline code you can use one backtick like this: r x in backticks which will result in: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Another important thing to know is that you can utilize what are called child Rmd files in case your report is getting to large (something that often happens with analyses). In this case, you can separate out parts of your research process into different report documents and have an additional report document that demonstrates the entire process. See here for more information on how to do this. Also see Riederer (n.d.) for additional information about how to use and create R markdown files. 6.8 Jupyter Jupyter notebooks are very similar to R markdown reports, however they were designed with an emphasis on using python rather than R. JupyterLab is also similar to Rstudio. However it is a web-based environment for working with code and writing Juptyer notebooks. You can try some demos here. Narrative can be added using a similar syntax as R markdown, except that in this case it is the classic version of markdown. References "]]
