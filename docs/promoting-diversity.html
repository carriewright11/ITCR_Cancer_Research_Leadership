<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Diversity is beneficial</h2>
<p>Beyond the critical importance of giving everyone more fair opportunities (which cannot be overstated), there are many additional crucial reasons why diversity is particularly important for science and health research.</p>
<p>The inclusion of diverse research team members may promote more inclusive research questions and practices to help the populations that need better health care the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States are at disproportionate risk of being uninsured, lacking access to care, and experiencing worse health outcomes from preventable and treatable conditions.”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jackson_addressing_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Jackson and Gracia 2014</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“…Compared with the general population, racial/ethnic minority populations have poorer health outcomes from preventable and treatable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, <strong>cancer</strong>, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome than those in the majority.”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jackson_addressing_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Jackson and Gracia 2014</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“… the social environment in which people live, learn, work, and play contributes to disparities and is among the most important determinants of health throughout the course of life.”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jackson_addressing_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Jackson and Gracia 2014</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More diverse research teams may be more aware of the cultural differences and social determinants that may influence the health of the people that the research could serve. Such consideration could further increase the impact of the research.</p>
<p>The inclusion of diverse populations in scientific teams has also been shown to improve innovation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hofstra_diversityinnovation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hofstra et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Scholars from underrepresented groups have origins, concerns, and experiences that differ from groups traditionally represented, and their inclusion in academe diversifies scholarly perspectives. In fact, historically underrepresented groups often draw relations between ideas and concepts that have been traditionally missed or ignored.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hofstra_diversityinnovation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hofstra et al. 2020</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Underrepresentation in cancer informatics</h2>
<p>Despite the benefits of diversity in research teams, analyses of scientific article authorship indicate that women are underrepresented in computational biology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bonham_women_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Bonham and Stefan 2017</a>)</span> and biomedical engineering <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-aguilar_authorship_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Aguilar et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, analyses of university faculty and students demonstrate that both women and historically marginalized populations (such as certain racial and ethnic groups and <a href="https://ok2bme.ca/resources/kids-teens/what-does-lgbtq-mean/">LGBTQ+</a> individuals) remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the US and in Europe <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hofstra_diversityinnovation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hofstra et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-chaudhary_ten_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Chaudhary and Berhe 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-cech_systemic_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Cech and Waidzunas 2021</a>)</span>.
Despite very often facing discrimination and less support, many individuals of these underrepresented groups have greatly contributed to scientific achievement, which demonstrates the potential innovation that could be achieved when research teams are more diverse.</p>
<p>Many Black scientists are responsible for great human achievements that changed the world including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.biography.com/scientist/katherine-g-johnson">Katherine Johnson</a>: Katherine Johnson was a mathematician who helped enable humans to venture into space. Katherine worked for NASA in the 1960s during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race">Space Race</a>. A depiction of her work and some of the discrimination that she faced while working for NASA is featured in the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures"><em>Hidden figures</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Thomas">Vivien Thomas</a>: Vivien was a pioneer in <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/giving/vtfund.html">heart surgery at Johns Hopkins</a> when it was considered taboo. He is credited for assisting in creating a life saving surgical operation to improve the oxygenation of children with congenital heart defects. This operation was pivotal in paving the way for other heart surgical procedures.</p></li>

<p>Scientists and Mathematicians of Latin American or Hispanic origin have also greatly contributed and continue to contribute to scientific innovation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Mario%20Molina">Mario Molina</a>: Mario was born in Mexico and came to the United States for graduate school. He was a chemist and environmental scientist and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for his work in discovering the environmental impact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)</a> gases on the Earth’s ozone layer. This work was critical in changing policies (starting in the 1980s) to protect our environment from these chemicals which were widely used as aerosols, solvents and refrigerants. Through these policies, many countries around the world have banned or greatly reduced the manufacturing of these chemicals. <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/38685/the-ozone-layer-if-cfcs-hadnt-been-banned">NASA projections</a> suggest that the ozone would have been largely depleted by 2060 if these chemicals were manufactured at previous historical rates. See <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/WorldWithoutOzone/page1.php">here</a> for more information on what would have likely happened to the world if CFCs were not banned.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nps.gov/people/ynes-mexia.htm">Ynes Mexia</a>: Ynes began her career as a botanist in her fifties in the 1920s. She traveled widely (often by herself (which was very unusual at the time)) collecting and characterizing plants. She unfortunately passed away at 68 cutting her botany career short to only 13 years. However, in that time she collected over 145,000 specimens and made numerous discoveries. Her legacy in botany had such an impact that a genius is named after her. She is also highly regarded for her efforts in environmental conservation, particularly for helping to preserve the redwood forests in the United States.</li>

<p>This adventurous woman has been quoted for saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any place in the world where a woman can’t venture.”</p>

<div id="underrepresentation-in-clinical-trials" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Underrepresentation in clinical trials</h2>
<p>Beyond underrepresentation of certain populations within research teams, there is also a lack of representation of various populations in clinical trials (in particular woman and people of specific racial and ethnic groups) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span>. This is particularity true for cancer clinical trial studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nazha_enrollment_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nazha et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Furthermore there is also limited data collected about LGBTQ+ individuals <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chen_approach_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Chen et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>According to an FDA study in 2018, Black people represented 13.4% of the population, yet only 5% of clinical trial participants, while Hispanics and people of Latin American ancestry made up 18.1% of the population at the time, but less than 1% of clinical trial participants <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coakley_dialogues_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Coakley et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when looking at oncology trials, whites (80% of participants) and males (59.8% of participants) continue to be overrepresented, according to a study in 2019 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nazha_enrollment_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nazha et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This lack of diversity in clinical trials is a problem because this results in less understanding about how particular patients will fare with a given treatment/vaccine/diagnosis etc. This lack of knowledge can result in furthering inequities in medical care <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Demographic studies of the United States demonstrate that racial and ethnic populations that have been historically underrepresented in clinical trials and in STEM have grown and are predicted to make up 50% of the population by 2045 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Thus for medical care to best serve the current and future population of the United States, trials especially need to be more representative of the diverse groups that make up our country.</p>
<p>Research suggests the following reasons for the lack of diversity in clinical trials:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> <strong>Historical injustice</strong></h3>
<p>According to studies, marginalized groups such as Native Americans, people of Hispanic or Latin American ancestry, and Black Americans understandably distrust researchers at higher rates than white individuals due to historical injustices and inadequate medical care. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-studies_inclusion_1999" role="doc-biblioref">Mastroianni, Faden, and Federman</a> (<a href="#ref-studies_inclusion_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span></p>

In the 1950s, a study was conducted to examine the thyroid gland in Alaskan natives, in which participants were given doses of radioactive iodine that exceeded current recommendations. Beyond the riskiness of the dose of radiation, this study was unethical due to inadequate translation of research methods and consent forms, thus participants were not able to be properly informed about the risks of the study and therefore not able to provide proper consent.

<p>Beyond such examples of extremely unethical studies and practices, marginalized populations such as people of certain racial and ethnic ancestry have also historically received poorer access to health care and poorer quality health care, thus discouraging their engagement with the health care system. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-griffith_determinants_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Griffith et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-studies_inclusion_1999" role="doc-biblioref">Mastroianni, Faden, and Federman 1999</a>; <a href="#ref-fitzgerald_implicit_2017" role="doc-biblioref">FitzGerald and Hurst 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-hodge_no_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Hodge 2012</a>)</span></p>
<p>Many racial and ethnic groups in the US were historically more likely to be uninsured compared to white people and although coverage rates have been better in more recent history, unequal rates remain to today.<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jul_16_health_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Damico 2021</a>)</span></p>

<p>Even with similar access to care (which can be reduced by sociodemographic factors), people of marginalized racial and ethnic groups still have a history of receiving inferior health care <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-griffith_determinants_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Griffith et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These two issues among others have led to health disparities, including for cancer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An analysis of 1 million patients with cancer in the United States showed that blacks or African Americans have a 28% higher <strong>cancer-specific mortality</strong> compared with whites. This survival gap is independent of sociodemographic factors, disease stage, and access to treatments. Indeed, disparities exist along the continuum of care, from screening, access to care, and referral to subspecialty centers, to enrollment in clinical trials that define new approaches to cancer treatment. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nazha_enrollment_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nazha et al. 2019</a>)</span></p>

<div id="poor-recruitment-and-inclusion" class="section level3" number="5.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> <strong>Poor recruitment and inclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Due to concern about the time and effort required to find a more diverse set of participants and also due to implicit bias, many populations are not recruited at the same rate. <strong>Implicit bias</strong> is an unconscious negative evaluation of a person based on characteristics that are irrelevant <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fitzgerald_implicit_2017" role="doc-biblioref">FitzGerald and Hurst 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the available evidence, physicians and nurses manifest implicit biases to a similar degree as the general population. The following characteristics are at issue: race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status (SES), age, mental illness, weight, having AIDS, brain injured patients perceived to have contributed to their injury, intravenous drug users, disability, and social circumstances <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fitzgerald_implicit_2017" role="doc-biblioref">FitzGerald and Hurst 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this can result in researchers not including certain populations in their trials.
Indeed healthcare professionals have been shown to withhold care, such as treatment based on their own bias about if a particular individual would adhere to the protocol. Thus marginalized groups often aren’t even recruited for clinical trials <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ACRP_representation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Studies of attempts to regulate oncology trial participation to be more inclusive, show that still 48% did not meet target recruitment goals for recruiting underrepresented populations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ACRP_representation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>In a study of clinical trial participants of marginalized groups, participants stated that they were more likely to trust a researcher if they seemed scientifically knowledgeable but also had an understanding of the <strong>history</strong> and <strong>context</strong> of the study population, as well as experience working with that population <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-griffith_determinants_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Griffith et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>In addition, participants noted that the enthusiasm, commitment, or passion of the researcher to help the population of interest and to study the topic of interest influenced how trustworthy the researcher appeared to be. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-griffith_determinants_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Griffith et al. 2020</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants also state that the feel more trusting and more willing to participant in trials with a researcher of a similar background. Thus, improving the diversity of research teams and supporting underrepresented investigators may help to recruit more diverse participants for clinical trials <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ACRP_representation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> <strong>Barriers of access</strong></h3>
<p>In a 2019 study, access to oncology trials was found to only be available to about 27% of US cancer patients <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nazha_enrollment_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nazha et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are many barriers to this access:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Language:
One major important barrier is translation of recruitment materials to other languages.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduling:
Another barrier can be the time at which participants are needed to be in person for a clinical trial. Some individuals need more accommodation if for example they can’t come to appointments during work hours due to having a job with an inflexible work schedule or due to care taking responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation &amp; location:
If it is more time consuming to get to appointments due to a need for public transportation or because an individual lives in a different area of town this can inhibit participation and retention of participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Health Literacy:
For individuals who don’t have the time, education, or other means necessary to learn about the importance of specific health interventions or preventative practices for example, they may not be recruited for trials as well as individuals that are regularly concerned with their health and spend leisure time investigating information about their health.<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ACRP_representation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al. 2020</a>)</span></p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.6</span> <strong>Lack of community engagement funding</strong></h3>
<p>There has been historically a lack of funding to support equitable engagement of community stakeholders. However, community engagement can build trust, reduce stigma, increase access, recruitment and retention of more diverse participants for clinical trials.</p>
<p>Recent projects in which participants are recruited through community engagement, such as <a href="https://projectbrotherhood.net/about-us/">Project Brotherhood</a> (a community based project, that provides Black men in Chicago with health education within their communities) have been shown to help increase health screen participation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.7</span> <strong>Other aspects of funding</strong></h3>
<p>Most clinical trials are funded by the pharmaceutical industry which often leads to pressure for a more homogeneous population to improve the opportunity to see effects in patients without confounding patient-specific factors. However, trials that are funded by the NIH include more diverse participants that are more representative of the true population of patients with cancer in the US <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ACRP_representation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Provide adequate financial, logistical, and time support</li>
</ol>
<p>Investigators should consider how to support caregivers who have important obligations, such as tending to their family members or others. For example when possible, perhaps home visits would be feasible. Other strategies include providing flexible hours for trial visits and support for transportation, such as payment for a rideshare service or taxi.<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ACRP_representation_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yates et al. 2020</a>)</span> Researchers should also consider providing patients with a cell phone to improve communication <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Finally, participants may also need extra assistance to cope with healthcare needs following participation in a study, particularly if this interferes with their typical obligations.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>More promotion of health care access in general</li>
</ol>
<p>Individuals have been shown to be more likely to participate when advised by a health care provider.<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clark_increasing_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2019</a>)</span> Increasing health care system access in general could improve clinical trial participation, by increasing opportunities for health care providers to interact with individuals who could participate in a trial.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>More promotion of community engagement</li>
</ol>
<p>Community stakeholders can help to assess if recruitment information is culturally appropriate and can help with creating more equitable recruitment strategies.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>More inclusive research teams</li>
</ol>
<p>As stated earlier, individuals have been shown to be more trusting when research teams include members that have a similar background to themselves <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-griffith_determinants_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Griffith et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">

This involves collecting more information about non-binary individuals, for example providing response options to questions about gender so that an individual who was assigned female at birth, but is now male can adequately provide this information. Similarly, more detailed information about ancestry (for example providing more specific Latin American ancestry options as opposed to just Latin American) could also lead to more informative findings about specific populations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Ways to better support a more diverse research team</h2>
<p>In order to best support and encourage mentees and employees of underrepresented groups in cancer informatics, we suggest that lab leaders do the following:</p>
<div id="seek-additional-training-about-disparities-in-informatics-and-stem-careers" class="section level3" number="5.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.1</span> Seek additional <strong>training about disparities</strong> in informatics and STEM careers</h3>
<p>Especially focus on hindrances to achievement such as <strong>attitudes</strong>, <strong>biases</strong>, and <strong>stereotypes</strong>. Also, become aware of <strong>stereotype threat (also called stereotyped inferiority)</strong> - “an internal feeling and concern about confirming a negative stereotype associated with a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, and age) with which the individual identifies”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stelter_establishing_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021</a>)</span> and how they might influence your mentees.</p>
<p>Here is a great video of <a href="https://www.law.umaryland.edu/directory/profile.asp?id=492">Russell McClain</a> at the University of Maryland that introduces how implicit bias and stereotype threat impact higher education:</p>
<!-- <p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" alt = "video of Russell McClain on biases and stereotypes" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yiZQaE0q9BY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> -->

</iframe>
<p>Note that you may not be aware of all the barriers of achievement that your mentees may face. For example, mentees from low socioeconomic backgrounds, mentees with disabilities, mentees who have immigrated, older mentees, mentees of traditionally underrepresented races and ethnic groups, and mentees with gender identities that are underrepresented face unique and sometimes overlapping challenges. This is not an complete list and it is also important to learn about how <strong>intersectionality</strong> (the idea that some individuals may represent more than one underrepresented group (ex. female and Black)) results in more nuanced challenges.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender is considered, women of color report even less access to mentorship and support from mentors than other groups. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davis_barriers_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Davis et al. 2021</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a great video of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw">Kimberlé Crenshaw</a> (at UCLA and Columbia) describing the theory of intersectionality, which she developed:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViDtnfQ9FHc" width="100%" height="400px" data-external="1">
</iframe>
<p>Also, become aware of <strong>microaggressions</strong> - “subtle verbal and nonverbal slights, insults, or invalidating remarks directed at individuals due to their membership in a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, age, and physical disability), which are rooted in biases about individuals in that group”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stelter_establishing_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

As a result, those with this mindset reach ever-higher levels of achievement. All this gives them a greater sense of free will." width="100%" /></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.7</span> <strong>Celebration and microaffirmations</strong></h3>
<p>Be sure to celebrate <strong>all</strong> of your mentees’ small and large successes. This has been shown to promote confidence and resilience <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stelter_establishing_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Be generous complementing or pointing out small success in discussions with your mentees and thank your mentees for performing tasks that they may assist you or your lab.</p>
<p>For larger successes, consider sharing a meal or other social activity with your lab. For virtual or remote lab members this could be playing a game online.</p>
<p>Again aim to do this with all your mentees/lab members. Be mindful about not singling out particular mentees. This could further make such lab members feel like they don’t belong.</p>
</div>
<div id="give-feedback-with-cultural-sensitivity" class="section level3" number="5.7.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.8</span> <strong>Give feedback with cultural sensitivity</strong></h3>
<p>It is important to be aware that your mentee may be struggling with feeling like they don’t belong when you provide feedback <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stelter_establishing_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stelter, Kupersmidt, and Stump 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-lee_natures_2007" role="doc-biblioref">Lee, Dennis, and Campbell 2007</a>)</span>. Thus, when given criticism, certain mentees who may especially feel like they don’t belong because of their background differences, may feel very discouraged. Try to still be encouraging when delivering criticism by acknowledging what is going well and what is progressing.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://online.alvernia.edu/articles/constructive-criticism-in-the-workplace/">article</a> has several good tips for delivering criticism that we will summarize here with our own thoughts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Allow for a discussion about what went wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may learn that your mentee struggled for an entirely different reason than you expected. Having a discussion allows you to better determine how your mentee might be able to perform better in the future.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Give criticism in a sandwich.</li>
</ol>
<p>Say something positive, deliver the criticism, then say something else positive.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Focus on the actions instead of personality traits. Think about how they can improve.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, instead of saying “You seem to have time management issues,” you could say something like, “Navigating and prioritizing all these projects is a difficult task and I think we can do better as a team.”</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be specific and suggest improvements.</li>
</ol>
<p>You want your mentees to know exactly what they should be aiming to improve and why. Vague criticism may reduce their confidence and will not help them improve as much as concrete specific suggestions and discussion.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Deliver criticism in private.</li>
</ol>
<p>Especially if your mentee is feeling like they don’t belong, criticism in front of other lab members can really impact their confidence. It can also lead to more unhealthy competitive dynamics between lab members.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t surprise your mentees with criticism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Build criticism into regular meetings with your mentee. Don’t create a meeting out of the blue to tell them they need to improve as this may cause excess stress. Secondly, criticism can be normalized if it is delivered gently and in the ways we just outlined.</p>

<div id="consider-creating-a-document-of-mentor-and-mentee-expectations." class="section level3" number="5.7.9">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.9</span> Consider creating a document of <strong>mentor and mentee expectations</strong>.</h3>
<p>These documents help clarify what mentees can expect. This is helpful for your mentees to better perform according to expectations, as they are explicitly stated rather than intuited.</p>

<p>Also see <a href="https://ictr.wisc.edu/mentoring/">here</a> for more information about such documents. Keep in mind that such forms should be tailored for different career stages of your mentees and for mentees who are pursuing different expertise. Informatics mentees should incorporate guidelines about data management practices. We will discuss a bit more about that in the next chapter.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope that these guidelines will help you to create a safe and more comfortable environment for all of your lab members and to support your team to be more mindful about health inequity when conducting research. We believe that a happier and more inclusive lab has the potential to be more productive and innovative.</p>
