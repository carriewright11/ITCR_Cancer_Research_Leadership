<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Identifying good informatics questions</h2>
<p>Once you have identified your research team, your next step is to start thinking more deeply about the specific informatics questions you would like to evaluate. <strong>Be sure to include team members of each discipline in these discussions.</strong></p>
<p>There are many important considerations to keep in mind when asking an informatics question:</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-project_guidelines_files/figure-html/1OU5qeRgN_fojGbcyu2qEdwlcKpDO6BveWtYW_u1Hqd4_gd8ed090282_0_156.png" title=" Considerations for informatics questions: 1) Is it testable experimentally and informatically speaking? 2) Is it feasible (in terms of cost, time, resources - such as data storage)? Does public data already exist? 3) Are we using the appropriate methods (experimentally and informatically)? 4) Are we considering confounders, biases, controls etc.? 5) What will this mean for the scientific community and my lab members if this succeeds? 6) What will this mean for my lab members if this fails? Are there a back-up plans?" alt=" Considerations for informatics questions: 1) Is it testable experimentally and informatically speaking? 2) Is it feasible (in terms of cost, time, resources - such as data storage)?

<p>We suggest the following steps to take a great scientific question and make into a great informatically testable question.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Steps for forming questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start with what you know and determine what is unknown</li>
<li>Clarify what is most important to learn about what is unknown. What key information would lead to more understanding? What would be most helpful to know to lead to a new treatment or prevention strategy? What would lead to more questions?</li>
<li>Narrow down what is unknown into specific statements based on what you identified as important to know from step 2.</li>
<li>Write the unknown statements into specific questions. (Look out for vague phrases!)</li>
<li>Make the questions into actionable tests by thinking about what would be measured or observed and ultimately what your variables would be in a statistical test.</li>
<li>Make a mock-up of what the data would look like. (Do you have necessary controls?)</li>
<li>Evaluate if that actionable test can be assessed with statistical methods and if you have access or can collect the necessary data. Rework as necessary, possibly returning to a different question from step 5. Think about possible biases or confounders.</li>
<li>Evaluate if the interpretation of the test would provide the insights that you are interested in.</li>

<p>For example, say we were interested in identify new diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer.
<em><strong>Note:</strong> this is only an illustrative example.</em></p>

</div>
<div id="step-1" class="section level3" number="3.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> STEP 1</h3>
<p>First we would identify what is known and unknown:</p>
<p>Several potential blood-based biomarkers for colorectal cancer have been identified, however many are lacking evidence due to the previous studies having small sample sizes.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-project_guidelines_files/figure-html/1OU5qeRgN_fojGbcyu2qEdwlcKpDO6BveWtYW_u1Hqd4_gd8ed090282_0_189.png" title=" Image of table with information about biomarkers identified with various studies for this article: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2019.01284/full " alt=" Image of table with information about biomarkers identified with various studies for this article: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2019.01284/full " width="100%"  /></p>

<p>You might ask how useful are these biomarkers for diagnosing colorectal cancer?</p>
<p>So now we think about what is unknown:</p>
<p>You know the sizes of the previous samples that have assessed these biomarkers and you know the level of sensitivity reported by previous reports. However, it is unknown how sensitive and specific some of these biomarkers are with sufficient sample sizes. It is unknown how collectively these biomarkers help to identify patients with cancer. It is unknown which biomarkers are more important. It is unknown which biomarkers or combinations are particularly useful for determining disease progression or what treatment options might be best.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level3" number="3.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> STEP 2</h3>
<p>Step 2 then involves determining which unknowns are the most important to you. This could be what is more translatable to aiding better diagnostics in a noninvasive way. This could be to better understand cancer progression and what these biomarkers tell us about patient prognosis. Determine what unknowns best fit your interest/expertise. Let’s say that we want to know what is most translatable to aiding diagnostic tests now.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3" class="section level3" number="3.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> STEP 3</h3>
<p>Step 3 then involves writing out specific statements for what is unknown related to making these biomarkers more useful for tests now.</p>
<p>It is unknown how useful many of these biomarkers are individually for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer in larger samples. It is unknown if combining these biomarkers together is useful in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. It is unknown if combining these blood-based screens with other screens is useful.</p>
<p>You can probably imagine many more statements, but we will keep this example simple.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-4" class="section level3" number="3.1.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5</span> STEP 4</h3>
<p>Step 4 involves transforming these into questions:</p>
<p>How useful are these biomarkers for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer?
How useful is the combination of these biomarkers for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer?
How useful is the combination of any of these biomarkers with other non-blood-based screens?</p>
<p>Look for terms of phrases that our vague in your questions and make them more specific. For simplicity purposes we will stick with only the second question.</p>
<p>The phrase “How useful” can be more specific.</p>
<p>Does a combination of the detection of these biomarkers improve diagnostic sensitivity for colorectal cancer than single biomarkers alone?</p>
<p>Ok that’s getting better!</p>
</div>
<div id="step-5" class="section level3" number="3.1.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> STEP 5</h3>
<p>Step 5 is to transform questions into actionable tests. For a question to be testable it must meet several requirements. We need to have variables that can be measured or observed. We need to have a variable we can modify or control, and we need to figure out what we cannot control.</p>
<p>Now what are our variables, what can we control or observe? We will be observing diagnostic rates of colorectal cancer and biomarker expression, and we can modify or control how many biomarkers we choose to focus on to compare samples.</p>
<p>This leads to many questions:</p>
<p>Should we compare one biomarker vs all of the biomarkers?
Which single biomarker will we choose to compare to or will we look at all of them?
Do we have the sample sizes to allow for the statistical power for so many tests?
How will we look at the combination of biomarkers? A total score?
Will it be additive or something more complicated? For example, we could prioritize some biomarkers over others.</p>
<p>These are good questions to ask an informatics expert about. However we are getting to a more testable question. Now let’s really think about what the data we would need and what it would look like.</p>
<p>Which brings us to step 6 where we create a mock-up of the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-6" class="section level3" number="3.1.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.7</span> STEP 6</h3>
<p>Creating a mock-up of the data can make you ask yourself more questions about what you are asking and what you need to ask that question.
Would it be that we have blood results for these biomarkers for patients where we know (based on surgical pathology) if they have cancer?</p>
<p>What would these blood results look like?
Would it be absolute expression levels of mRNA or protein?
Do we have a threshold of elevated expression that we can use?
Will we assign samples as yes or no in terms of meeting this threshold or will we use an absolute quantity or relative percentage over this threshold?</p>
<p>Actually creating a mock-up of what the data might look like can reveal other important aspects that you may not yet have thought about. Thus here is the result of step 6.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-project_guidelines_files/figure-html/1OU5qeRgN_fojGbcyu2qEdwlcKpDO6BveWtYW_u1Hqd4_gd8ed090282_0_151.png" title="Example data showing 8 samples from 8 different patients 4 had the outcome of not cancer and 4 had the out come of cancer, there are 4 biomarker columns showing expression in relative percentage to threshold. Then there is a column that says meeting threshold count score based on the biomarkers which ranges from 2 to 3 and finally a column of the average percentage score" alt="Example data showing 8 samples from 8 different patients 4 had the outcome of not cancer and 4 had the out come of cancer, there are 4 biomarker columns showing expression in relative percentage to threshold.

</div>
<div id="step-7" class="section level3" number="3.1.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8</span> STEP 7</h3>
<p>Step 7 is then to think about what statistical tests you might perform. Could we use a t-test to compare the scores among the patient groups? Would we want to account for other factors like the patients age or gender? Would another test be better?</p>
</div>
<div id="step-8" class="section level3" number="3.1.9">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.9</span> STEP 8</h3>
<p>Step 8 is then to think about what this would mean. What would it mean if our results showed a difference in score between the groups? What can we interpret? Do we want to be able to predict patient status? This may involve moving back a step or two.</p>
<p>Remember that working with your research teammates can help you to come up with a better research plan before you start collecting data. By involving experts from different domains you can make the most out of your research efforts.</p>
<p>We would also suggest that you work with your informatics experts to come up with a biological research question (or set of questions) and a more technical question (or again set of questions) for each project. This can be a good strategy to ensure that everyone in your team gets authorship and that your team is as productive as possible.</p>
<p>For this example, your informatics employees or students might write a paper using simulated data or publicly available data to look at methods for creating biomarkers scores. Their studies could better inform you about how to think about testing the utility of colorectal biomarkers for diagnosis purposes.</p>
