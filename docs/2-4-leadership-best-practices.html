The blog post author, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/mick-watson">Professor Mick Watson</a> at the University of Edinburgh, describes these individuals as “pet bioinformaticians” in his blog called <a href="opiniomics.org">opiniomics</a>.</p>
<p>He states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is possible they [the pet bioinformaticians] will become isolated and pick up bad practices as they don’t have a senior bioinformatician to guide them. It also concerns me that their career and professional development might suffer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also acknowledges the challenges of the opposite case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Consider the opposite situation – how many bioinformatician PIs manage lab staff? How could we possibly guide a young post doc on how to run gels, PCRs etc nevermind more complicated laboratory SOPs?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has since then stated for the PIs of experts who do not share the same skill-sets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just look after them, and recognise you can’t give them everything that they need.You can give them a lot, just not everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Secondly, there is nothing wrong with being a pet bioinformatician – it can be a really stimulating role, and opens your eyes to lab-based science. I am not criticizing the pets either, I just urge you to look after yourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And ultimately provides a <a href="http://www.opiniomics.org/a-guide-for-the-lonely-bioinformatician/">guide</a> for the “pet bioinformaticians” that can be useful for both informatics expert employees/mentees and also for leaders of such individuals as well as for informatics lab leaders who employ lab-based scientists.</p>
<p>Extending the major themes from <a href="http://www.opiniomics.org/a-guide-for-the-lonely-bioinformatician/">his guide</a> and from his post about clinical labs <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">Watson 2014<span class="marginnote">Watson, Mick. 2014. <span>“The Lonely Bioinformatician Revisited: Clinical Labs <span><span></span></span>.”</span> <em>Opiniomics.org</em>. <a href="http://www.opiniomics.org/the-lonely-bioinformatician-revisited-clinical-labs/">http://www.opiniomics.org/the-lonely-bioinformatician-revisited-clinical-labs/</a>.</span>)</span> here are guidelines for multidisciplinary research lab leaders:</p>
<div id="recognize-that-different-disciplines-require-deep-expertise" class="section level3" number="2.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> <strong>Recognize that different disciplines require deep expertise</strong></h3>
<p>Informatics is truly it’s own scientific discipline that requires deep expertise.
To truly optimize the multidisciplinary work that you may wish to perform, you need expert level experience of all disciplines on your team. Although you may be able to learn how to use a particular tool to seemingly test an hypothesis, this may not be correct or optimal in every instance. This is why you need expert level informatics team members to help you with your research. If you can’t hire such an individual, or even if you hire a more junior informatics mentee or employee, you need to discuss your research with a senior informatics expert.</p>
</div>
<div id="avoid-employee-isolation" class="section level3" number="2.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> <strong>Avoid employee isolation</strong></h3>
<p>If possible, employ more than one domain expert or at least collaborate heavily with others - especially those with experience working with human data. Alternatively hire a more senior expert (with expertise studying in the domain you intend) with a higher salary.</p>
<p>In Mick Watson’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am aware of a few lone bioinformaticians working in clinical labs. I want to make this clear – this is a bad idea. In fact, it’s a terrible idea. Through no fault of their own, these guys will make mistakes. Those mistakes may have dire consequences if the data are then used to inform a treatment plan or diagnosis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, we highly encourage guideline #2 regardless of what option you choose.</p>
</div>
<div id="encourage-relationships-with-others-in-their-domain" class="section level3" number="2.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> <strong>Encourage relationships with others in their domain</strong></h3>
<p>Enable and encourage your employee to cultivate relationships with others who have similar skill-sets at your institution or local community. Ideally, help your employees or mentees find a <strong>mentor within their domain</strong>. If there is no local group of such individuals, see if your employee would be interested in starting one - such as a seminar group or journal club. Also encourage them to join online forums and attend conferences and workshops.</p>
<p>Examples include:
- <a href="https://rladies.org/">R ladies</a> for support for using Bioconductor or R programming. Many of the members are also very familiar with using a variety of genomics and imaging data. You do not need to be a woman to get support from this organization. - Many universities have a statistical support group, check at your institution.
- <a href="https://ncihub.org/groups/browse">National Cancer Institute ((NCI) hub groups</a> has a list of cancer specific groups such as large groups like the <a href="https://ncihub.org/groups/itcr">Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR)</a> or location specific groups such as the <a href="https://ncihub.org/groups/afrecc">African Esophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC)</a>
- When in doubt ask around. Ask at your institution, ask your former colleagues at other institutions, or try on social medial like twitter to find connections.</p>
</div>
<div id="encourage-growth-outside-their-domain" class="section level3" number="2.4.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> <strong>Encourage growth outside their domain</strong></h3>
<p>On the other hand, it is important that you also cultivate and encourage your employee’s growth in your domain by again suggesting and enabling their participation in conferences and journal clubs on topics relevant to your lab.</p>
</div>
<div id="value-their-perspective-about-science-in-general" class="section level3" number="2.4.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.5</span> <strong>Value their perspective about science in general</strong></h3>
<p>Encourage feedback and discussion from all of your employees in scientific discussions. Make their input feel welcomed regardless of the topic. A fresh perspective can sometimes lead to really important insights about things that are taken for granted by experts.</p>
</div>
<div id="discuss-expectations-and-hypotheses" class="section level3" number="2.4.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.6</span> <strong>Discuss expectations and hypotheses</strong></h3>
<p>If your employee is helping with work for a grant, provide the proposal to them. Have a discussion with your employee about your expectations and how feasible they are, as well as to make your informatics hypotheses specific. Avoid projects where the informatics goals are vague. Also remember that many informatics tasks may take more time than you anticipate and your employee may have a better sense of how long something will take (or vice versa if you are an informatics expert employing lab scientists). Be clear with your employee in these discussions that you are unclear about how long tasks will take, if that is indeed the case. Continue to have open dialogue about expectations and goals as the work proceeds.</p>
</div>
<div id="advocate-authorship-and-idea-generation-for-all" class="section level3" number="2.4.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.7</span> <strong>Advocate authorship and idea generation for all</strong></h3>
<p>Regardless of your employees’ or students’ backgrounds, make sure you advocate for authorship for each of them (particularly if they are interested in a career in research).</p>
<p>According to a recent report about computational biology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the fact that dramatic advancements have been driven by computational biology, too often researchers choosing this path languish in career advancement, publication, and grant review. <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">Carpenter et al. 2021<span class="marginnote">Carpenter, Anne E, Casey S Greene, Piero Carninci, Benilton S Cervalho, Michiel de Hoon, Stacey Finley, Jerry SH Lee, et al. 2021. <span>“Cultivating Computational Biology.”</span> <em>arXiv [q-Bio.OT]</em>, 12. <a href="https://doi.org/arXiv:2104.11364">https://doi.org/arXiv:2104.11364</a>.</span>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is often overlooked, but Informatics experts will also need <strong>first author papers</strong>. However, keep in mind that in some fields authors are listed in different ways.</p>
<p>Allow your employees to <strong>generate ideas</strong> for such publications and discuss this with them. Often the work to help with other projects may not be as interesting for your employee as an idea that they come up with themselves.</p>
<p>Often you can create one technical paper and one biological paper from each project. For technical papers, allow your lab members that largely do informatics to play a prominent/leadership role. For biological papers, ask them to play a supporting role. For experimental lab members do the opposite. Allow these lab members to have a prominent role on biological papers and a supporting role on more technical papers.</p>
<p>If nothing else, even if your employee is very busy on work for mid-level authorship, give them time to write a review or a software paper for a simple package, or a comparison of informatics methods. <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/mick-watson">Mick Watson</a> suggests making sure that your employees are authoring ~2 first author publications a year if possible. If necessary you can front-load collaboration work and then give your employee more time later to spend on their own work, but be careful about not protecting some of their time for their own career advancement. Also please see the Career Paths for Informatics Mentees section (coming up soon) and read it with your employees in mind, as well.</p>

<div id="check-on-them" class="section level3" number="2.4.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.8</span> <strong>Check on them!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Most importantly</strong>, make sure that your employee is getting help and feedback from other experts in their domain. It can be easy for your employee to get stuck or go in the wrong direction if left in isolation. How can you prevent this from happening? Keep tabs on what they are doing in general, if they are still working on the same issue for an extensive amount of time, suggest that they seek help. Also by encouraging your team members to cultivate relationships with experts you will provide them with the opportunity to ask others for their thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-external-review-of-work" class="section level3" number="2.4.9">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.9</span> <strong>Get external review of work</strong></h3>
<p>Particularly in informatics, we can especially track our steps. Make sure that your employees are keeping detailed records about their work and then get them to regularly ask for feedback from others. We all make mistakes, it’s good to get external feedback early and often to ensure that the work is correct.</p>
</div>
<div id="support-diverse-teammate-work-schedules" class="section level3" number="2.4.10">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.10</span> <strong>Support diverse teammate work schedules</strong></h3>
<p>One other important thing to know is that informatics work is often best performed with long stretches of uninterrupted time to allow your informatics employees to perform “deep work.”</p>
<p>Why is this? Some of the challenges that your informatics teammates will be working on will require a great deal of abstract thinking and troubleshooting. Such difficult work profits well from deep concentration.</p>
<p>How can you accommodate this? Try to work with your informatics teammates to schedule lab meetings and be mindful of other time commitments they might have, such as classes, seminars, or other meetings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are an informatics expert mentoring experimental biologists, keep in mind that their experiments will dictate their schedule. Impromptu meetings may be difficult for them at times. Also be aware that some of their experiments may require that they stay late at night or come in very early. Thus on those days, it might be best to not overburden them with other tasks if you want them done well.</p>
