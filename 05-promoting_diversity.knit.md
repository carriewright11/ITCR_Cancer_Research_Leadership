## Diversity is Beneficial

Beyond the critical importance of giving everyone more fair opportunities (which cannot be overstated), there are many additional crucial reasons why diversity is particularly important for science and health research.

The inclusion of diverse research team members promotes more inclusive research questions and practices to help the populations that need better health care the most.

> "Racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States are at disproportionate risk of being uninsured, lacking access to care, and experiencing worse health outcomes from preventable and treatable conditions."[@jackson_addressing_2014]

> "...Compared with the general population, racial/ethnic minority populations have poorer health outcomes from preventable and treatable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, **cancer**, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome than those in the majority."[@jackson_addressing_2014]

> "... the social environment in which people live, learn, work, and play contributes to disparities and is among the most important determinants of health throughout the course of life."[@jackson_addressing_2014]

More diverse research teams may be more aware of the cultural differences and social determinants that may influence the health of the people that the research could serve. Such consideration could further increase the impact of the research.

The inclusion of diverse populations in scientific teams has also been shown to improve innovation [@hofstra_diversityinnovation_2020].

> "Scholars from underrepresented groups have origins, concerns, and experiences that differ from groups traditionally represented, and their inclusion in academe diversifies scholarly perspectives. In fact, historically underrepresented groups often draw relations between ideas and concepts that have been traditionally missed or ignored." [@hofstra_diversityinnovation_2020]


## Underrepresentation in Cancer Informatics
 
However, analyses of scientific article authorship indicate that women are underrepresented in computational biology [@bonham_women_2017] and biomedical engineering [@aguilar_authorship_2019]. 

Furthermore, analyses of university faculty and students demonstrate that both women and historically marginalized populations (such as Black, Hispanic, and Native American) remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the US and in Europe [@hofstra_diversityinnovation_2020; @chaudhary_ten_2020].

## Ways to better support a more diverse research team

In order to best support and encourage mentees and employees of underrepresented groups in cancer informatics, we suggest that lab leaders do the following: 

### Seek additional **training about disparities** in informatics and STEM careers

Especially focus on hindrances to achievement such as **attitudes**, **biases**, and **stereotypes**.  Also, become aware of **stereotype threat** - "an internal feeling and concern about confirming a negative stereotype associated with a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, and age) with which the individual identifies"[@stelter_establishing_2021] and how they might influence your mentees.

Here is a great video of [Russell McClain](https://www.law.umaryland.edu/directory/profile.asp?id=492) at the University of Maryland that introduces how implicit bias and stereotype threat impact higher education:

Note that you may not be aware of all the barriers of achievement that your mentees may face. For example, mentees from low socioeconomic backgrounds, mentees with disabilities, mentees who have immigrated, older mentees, mentees of traditionally underrepresented races and ethnic groups, and mentees with gender identities that are underrepresented face unique and sometimes overlapping challenges. It is also important to learn about how **intersectionality** (the idea that some individuals may represent more than one underrepresented group (ex. female and black)) results in more nuanced challenges. 

For example:

> When the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender is considered, women of color report even less access to mentorship and support from mentors than other groups. [@davis_barriers_2021]


Here is a great video of [Kimberl√© Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw) at UCLA and Columbia  describes the theory of intersectionality, which she developed:
